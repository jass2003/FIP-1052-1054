# Project Name - Final Integrated Project  (couples resort-3 web pages)


## Description-
For my term's concluding assignment, I am tasked with enhancing the design and structure of three web pages from an existing website using HTML and CSS. This project has provided me with hands-on experience in various software applications, offering valuable insights into the tools required for website development. It has been a learning experience in planning, executing, and successfully delivering specific tasks.



## Technology used - 
In the context of my Final Integrated Projects (FIPs), I've employed several software tools such as Adobe XD, Photoshop, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and various media creation applications. Additionally, to enhance my organization and schedule, I utilize Google Calendar and Notion for project management. I've also established a dedicated timeline for each FIP to ensure efficient progress.
